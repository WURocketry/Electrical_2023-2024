/*
  An I2C based datalogger - Like the OpenLog but for I2C

  License: This code is public domain but you buy me a beer if you use this and we meet someday (Beerware license).

  This example shows how to create new files and write to them

  To Use:
    Insert a formatted SD card into Qwiic OpenLog
    Attach Qwiic OpenLog to a RedBoard or Uno with a Qwiic cable
    Load this sketch onto the RedBoard
    Open a terminal window to see the Serial.print statements
    Then insert the SD card into a computer view the log file contents

  Note: We can use the F("") in sketches to move big print statements into program memory to save RAM.
