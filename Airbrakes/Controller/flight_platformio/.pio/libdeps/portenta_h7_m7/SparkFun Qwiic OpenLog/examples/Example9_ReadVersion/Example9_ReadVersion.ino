  This example shows how to read the firmware version of Qwiic OpenLog.
  
  This is helpful when getting support. We will be adding features as we go and having the firmware
  version will let us know what features your board supports.

#include <Wire.h>

OpenLog myLog; //Create instance

int ledPin = LED_BUILTIN; //Status LED connected to digital pin 13

void setup()
{
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);

  Wire.begin();
  myLog.begin();

  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.print("Qwiic OpenLog Version: ");
  Serial.println(myLog.getVersion());

  Serial.println("Done!");
}

void loop()
{
  //Blink the Status LED because we're done!
  digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);

  digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
